# Adipose_SpliceQTL

## Description
Alternate splicing events can create isoforms that alter gene function, and genetic variants associated with alternate gene isoforms may reveal molecular mechanisms of disease. In this project, we use subcutaneous adipose tissue samples to identify splice junction quantitative trait loci (sQTL). We compare the results to both gene and exon eQTL in the same adipose tissue dataset. Finally, we identify colocalized sQTL signals with cardiometabolic traits to detect splicing events and candidate mechanisms that may contribute to gene function at GWAS loci.
